NOTE:  Some files were too big to upload to Github (Both web-qa and fileq&a were too large)


To run these programs, you must install all the packages used such as:
all the contnets in requirements.txt for both file q&a and web-qa
The requirments.txt contains all the packages that need to be installed for the programs to work properly


To run fileQ&A you need to have two powershell windows opens, one for the sever and one for the client.

For Webcrawlqa to work, edit the webcrawl-qa.py file and set CRAWL = 1.
